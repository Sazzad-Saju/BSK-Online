                    <p><b>Abstruct: </b>Vigenère cipher is an ancient elementary method that uses a series of Caesar shifting for encrypting plaintext to ciphertext protecting it from adversaries. However, a frequency analysis attack is vulnerable in this
                        type of cipher technique. This paper aims to enhance the security of the Vigenère cipher in a hybrid cryptosystem using a randomized approach including pseudorandom substitution, rearranging, padding, etc. In this approach, a complex
                        key generation algorithm is used that generates a pair of subkeys from an input key. One of the subkeys, Subkey1 is used to generate an intermediate ciphertext. The other key, Subkey2 is used to further scramble the ciphertext.
                        The slightest change in the input symmetric key produces an entirely different key pair. Hence, different encrypted results. It also increases the ranges of characters that Vigenère cipher can encrypt by including all ASCII and
                        extended ASCII. Finally, the symmetric key is encrypted with the public key of RSA solving the key distribution problem of the symmetric cipher. This enhanced and modified Vigenère cipher in the hybrid cryptosystem overcomes all
                        limitations of classical cipher and acts as a bridge between classical and modern cryptography.</p>

                    <h4 class="diffHeader">Is it safe?</h4>
                    <p>Although its a relatively new cipher model, the cryptosystem is convenient to consider as a fast and reliable method due to its complexity. A Hacker must know the cipher method and brute force the key which requires a lots of computational
                        power that it would take thousands of years to figure out under standard password requirement.</p>
                    <h4 class="diffHeader">What is the password requirement?</h4>
                    <p>To encrypt or decrypt user have to choose a password that meets certain criteria i.e. the password must hold at least 8 characters, must contain a letter, a digit and/or a special character. More password length means staying more
                        secure.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="diffHeader">Do you store anything on your server?</h4>
                    <p>Nothing is store during the process. This is a browser encryption which means all encryption/description will be done in browser, on your machine. In case of offline version, result will be coppied to the clipboard so user can store
                        on his own.</p>
                    <h4 class="diffHeader">What if I forget my password?</h4>
                    <p>Nothing can be done. If you forget your passowrd neighter password or message can be recovered. Both gone for rest. </p>
                    <h4 class="diffHeader">What could be the actual usage of this website?</h4>
                    <p>The BSK stream cipher is a reliable and secure encryption technique verified by professor <a href="https://hstu.ac.bd/teacher/masud" target="_blank">Masud Ibn Afjal</a>, dept. of CSE, HSTU. One can use it as a password manager. With
                        one master password, user can encrypt tons of other passwords of different sites and store data on Phone/PC securely. This enables user to use different complex passwords at different sites. But he must not forget his master password.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="diffHeader">Any difference between offline version and online version?</h4>
                    <p>Yes, random number production is different from each other, hence entire result exhibets differentiate. An online encrypted text requires online decryption and vice versa. The offline version is a console program (<a href="file/BSK Stream Cipher.exe">.exe file</a>)</p>
